# Introduction and Overview:

# Thermodynamics and Expansion en bref

# Setting Up motivation for BBN 

# NSE and Saha Equation

## What happens when it is not in equillibrium?

# Nuclear reaction structure and theory

# Weak rates

## Brief comments on rates and history of rates/FCZ I, II, ... V

## Brief note on eta and uncertainty of H, omegab h^2, all the same just different ways to express

# After all this, form the reaction matrix

### Solving!

# Implicit vs. Explicit methods and stability profiles

# Built-in solver and dynamic step size

# Actually solve it

# Vary through eta0?

# Vary through omegab h^2 to get famous plots
